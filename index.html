<h1>Photography Business Essentials</h1>

<hr>

<p>I've been a professional photographer for almost 4 years already and I have learned a few things
along the way. This is just a short list I made on the things that I feel are essential when running
a successful photo business.</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <h2>
            A Good Camera and a Better Lens
        </h2>
        <p>Many people think you need to spend a lot of money in order to get a good camera,
        but I spent almost my whole first year using an entry level DSLR camera. If you decide to drop a lot of money
        on something, I would suggest to get yourself a good camera and an even better lens. Anyone photographer will tell you
        that the lens is arguably the most important thing when it comes to taking a good photo.</p>

        <h2>
            Photo Editing Software
        </h2>
        <p>You got yourself a nice used camera and a beautiful new lens. Well now you need something to edit those awesome
        photos you just took. There is a lot of great photo editing programs to choose from, and I definitely feel that it is an
        essential part of your business. I, myself, use Adobe's photographer subscription which comes with lightroom, photoshop, and other useful tools
        that I use regularly. This subscription is only $10 a month and it pays for itself even if you only manage to get one session a month!</p>

    <li>
        <h2>
            A Strong Portfolio
        </h2>
        <p>This may be a little intimidating, but when I started I had to have something to show people before I actually started charging for my services.
         I started by giving out a few free sessions to friends and family in order to build up a small portfolio to have something to show.
        I would highly recommend practicing your photography and giving away a few sessions before you come up with your pricing. </p>

    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>
            A Solid Contract
        </h2>
        <p>Running into difficult clients is going to happen, it's inevitable. Having a good contract to cover you when someone gives you hard time about your work
         or when something unexpected happens that could potentially get you in trouble will be essential.</p>

    Final Thoughts

<p>
    If you were thinking of starting a photo business, I would definitely start with these few key points. A photo business can be a lot of work but
    it is worth it in the end when you seen that your clients are enjoying and promoting your work. I started with these few things and I have built up a pretty
    big portfolio with a lot of clients coming back for more sessions!
